how to use


add to scene

1-drag and drop.
2-instantiate the character with a code line like this
Instantiate(Resources.Load("prefab/jelly2"),position,rotation);



when the character die add this code line
jelly2.GetComponent<JellyDeath>().dead = true;
the character becomes a jelly spot ,an audio sound effect will be played ,and colliders will stop.


characters comes with 3 behaviours
-walker
-jumper
-floater

choose the behaviour before the scene start or after Instantiate line.

GameObject G = Instantiate(Resources.Load("prefab/jelly2"), transform.position, transform.rotation) as GameObject;
G.GetComponent<JellyBehaviour>().behaviour = JellyBehaviour.Behaviour.jumper;
